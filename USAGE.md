# Usage

## Requirements/Dependencies

You need to have command-line tools `fzf`, `curl`, `perl`, `fold` and `tput` installed.

## Usage as a shell script

Install this script into your path, e.g. in `~/bin`. At the first run, the script will download the personas from the repository and store them in `/tmp`.

You do not have to call it `find-persona`, you can rename the script to whatever you want.

## Basic Usage

Download or copy the repo. Make the Bash script file `scripts/find-persona` able to run.  
Run `scripts/find-persona` without any arguments. A window will pop up with a list of personas. Keep typing some keywords. The fuzzy-finder `fzf` will make the list shorter and show a preview window inside the terminal.  
Pick one row from the left side of the screen and press the enter key.

| Interactive Selection in a Terminal Window:   <br>Preview generated by Fuzzy-Finder <code>fzf</code>|
|----------|
|  Inside Terminal, after typing `scripts/find-persona` this should pop up  |
| ![fzf in action](img/screenshot-terminal-find-persona.png)  |
|  Use the arrow keys to scroll, or type more keywords to narrow down the list shown in left half  |

In the picture above,

- The left side shows the available personas.
- The right side shows the best matching persona.
- The highlighted text is the selected prompt for the typed keyword(s).

Pick one row and press enter. The script will print the persona definition as a ready-to-run `export` command to the terminal. The command `export CI=<prompt text>` sets a variable `CI` - "`C`ustom `I`nstruction". The long prompt text is saved in a two-letter `$CI` environment variable.

Note that the interactive selection _did not actually export_ `CI` as an environment variable. You can do that manually by pressing enter again, if you want to use `$CI` in later commands.

See [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md) for a more detailed example.

## More Prompts and Personas

Some good collections, presented with both good Prompt Design and GUI Design in mind, and with a lot of additional information:

- [Prompt Library](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/prompt-library) by Anthropic AI for Claude LLM
- [Prompts from top-rated GPTs in the GPTs Store](https://github.com/ai-boost/awesome-prompts) - Anonymously curated by "AI-Boost". 4.9k Stars on Guthub as of Aug. 2024.

There are many, many more such collections on the web. The above two are just examples.
