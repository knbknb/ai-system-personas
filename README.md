# AI LLM Personas

```text
An opinionated list of LLM personas, grouped by topic. 
See the "personas-grouped-sorted.csv" file for the actual personas.
```

This is my personal version of a collection of personas, or prompt modifiers, or custom instructions. These are for interactions with LLMs, AI-systems.  
They are not "system personas" in the sense of user interface design.

Processing/Usage is illustrated with the Shellscripts in the `scripts/` directory, in [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md).

## Usage

How I use it in my workflow: See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#my-personal-usage), [EXAMPLE.md](./EXAMPLE.md), and my repo [perplexity-api-search](https://github.com/knbknb/perplexity-api-search).
