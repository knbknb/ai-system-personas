# AI LLM Personas

```text
An opinionated list of LLM roles, or personas, grouped by topic. 
See the "roles-grouped-sorted.csv" file for the actual roles.
```

This is my personal version of a collection of roles, also known as personas, prompt modifiers, custom instructions, or similar terms. These are for human-AI interactions with LLMs, Large Language Models such as ChatGPT.  

It works like this:

> "As a web developer and software tester, be critical of the code input I provide and provide me with a list of issues in the code."

Processing/Usage is further illustrated in [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) below, and in the Shellscripts in the `scripts/` directory.

## Usage

How I use it in my workflow: See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#my-personal-usage), [EXAMPLE.md](./EXAMPLE.md), and my repo [perplexity-api-search](https://github.com/knbknb/perplexity-api-search).
