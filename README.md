# AI LLM Personas

```text
An opinionated list of LLM personas, grouped by topic. 
See the "personas-grouped-sorted.csv" file for the actual personas.
```

This is my personal version of a collection of personas, or prompt modifiers, or custom instructions. These are for interactions with LLMs, AI-systems.  
They are not "system personas" in the sense of user interface design.

Processing/Usage is illustrated with the Shellscripts in the `scripts/` directory, in [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md).

## Advanced Usage

How I use it in my workflow: See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#my-personal-usage), and my repo [perplexity-api-search](https://github.com/knbknb/perplexity-api-search)

## Previously

This is a continuation of the work started in [my awesome-chatgpt-prompts repo](https://github.com/knbknb/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/) which in turn was a fork of [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts).

My fork has diverged to a point where it's no longer compatible with the original repo, so I've started a new one.
